# BSc-application - Web application for planning mountain trips

This is application made as a Bachelor of Science Project "Web application for planning mountain trips". Technologies which have been used:
- PostgreSQL as a database with PostGIS extension for spatial data,
- Django Framework for backend,
- GDAL for processing raster datasets,
- ReactJS for frontend,
- React-Leaflet for map handling.


The aim of the project was to create a web application to support the process of planning mountain trips. 
Its main functions include determining the route between two points and visualizing the terrain with graphs. 
The system also supports user registration and login, which allows access to additional features of the application. 
These include adding selected routes to one's profile and later viewing and deleting them.

The project was graded 5 and received positive reviews.
